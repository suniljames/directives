# Multi-Agent Architecture

> **Canonical config:** [`agents.yml`](../agents.yml) — agent types, providers, assignments.
> **Role roster:** [`teams/engineering/manifest.yml`](../teams/engineering/manifest.yml)

One AI model acting as both [builder and validator](../docs/glossary.md) creates correlated failures — shared blind spots and no independent verification. The model that builds should not validate.

## Principle

Split roles across abstract **agent types** — a **builder** and a **validator** — backed by different LLM providers when available. Different models with different training and biases catch different things; the overlap in what they miss shrinks significantly. Types and assignments: [`agents.yml`](../agents.yml). Role mappings: [`manifest.yml`](../teams/engineering/manifest.yml).

## Agent Types

| Type | Purpose | Capabilities |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Builder** | Creates work — implements, produces, deploys | edit_files, run_tests, deploy, merge |
| **Validator** | Reviews work — audits, checks quality, flags issues | review_code, write_specs, file_issues |

## Provider Assignment

Default assignments and fallback chains are in `agents.yml`. When the preferred provider is unavailable, the system falls back to the next provider in the chain.

### Single-Provider Fallback

When only one provider is available, it runs both agent types in **isolated sessions**:

1. **Session isolation** — Validator runs in a separate session with no shared builder context.
2. **Mandatory fresh-eyes validation** — Required (not optional) in single-provider mode.
3. **Explicit role priming** — Validator prompt: *"You are the validator agent. You did NOT create this work. Review it independently."*

This is less effective than two different models but significantly better than one session doing both. The key is that the validator has no memory of the builder's reasoning — it can't inherit assumptions it never saw.

## Build-then-Validate Flow

```
Builder implements → Validator reviews → Builder addresses feedback
```

1. **PM (validator)** writes requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **EM (builder)** plans work, assigns tasks, oversees execution
3. **Engineer, Architect, Data, AI/ML, UX (builder)** implement the feature
4. **QA Engineer (validator)** tests against requirements
5. **Security Engineer (validator)** audits for vulnerabilities
6. **SRE (builder)** deploys and monitors
7. **Writer (validator)** documents the feature

## Coordination Protocol

- **Structured artifacts** — PRDs, test reports, review comments follow defined formats
- **File-based exchange** — Both agents read/write to the repo. The repo is the source of truth.
- **Explicit acceptance criteria** — PM defines "done." QA verifies "done."
- **Label-driven coordination** — Agents check issue labels to determine pipeline stage
- **PR labels** — Autonomous PRs labeled `ai:autonomous`
- **Review findings** — Posted with [severity levels](../docs/glossary.md) (see [`code-review-framework.md`](../teams/engineering/process/code-review-framework.md))

## Guiding Principles

1. **Builders need tooling.** Code, infrastructure, and runtime roles belong on the builder.
2. **Validators should be independent.** Audit and review roles gain most from a different model.
3. **Keep the boundary clean.** Building on one agent, auditing on the other. Explicit handoffs.
4. **Rationale must be technical.** Assignments based on capability and fit, not marketing.
